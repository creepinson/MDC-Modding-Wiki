# Setting Up Your IDE & Your First Mod Classes
This section of the tutorial requires the New Project tutorial to be completed first.
### The IDE

The first thing you need to do after you have set up your first mod
(see the [new project tutorial here](https://mod-devcafeteam.github.io/MDC-Modding-Wiki/pages/1_12/getting_started/new_project)) 
is to download and open your IDE of choice. I recommend using Intellij IDEA, but you can also use Eclipse.

You can find a link to download [eclipse here](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads). Intellij IDEA can be downloaded and installed [from here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download). For Intellij IDEA, I would go with the community edition.
Once you have installed the IDE, you can start coding by opening the IDE.

If you are using Eclipse, browse to the eclipse directory in the folder where you have your build.gradle file.
If you are using IDEA, simply browse to the build.gradle file directly, and you can import the gradle project.
